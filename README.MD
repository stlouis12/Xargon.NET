# Xargon.NET

This repository is an attempt at using Gemini to post the classic DOS game Xargon to .NET using SDL3. 95% of this code is generated by Gemini from the original games source code. This is largely an experiment to see how far AI can go and so far the results are mixed. The SDL3-CS library references were largely broken. It seems that Gemeni was pulling all the method names used in the C library and also mixed some in that were changed from SDL2 to SDL3. There's still a lot to port and I have no idea if it will work but I aim to push through because I can and I'm curious. 

I chose .NET/C# because it's what I know best. Most of my experience in it has been more of a utilitarian nature and I haven't touched it really since .Net Core 3 was new so I'm a little rusty and covering new territory which makes for a fun experience.

Ideally I'd like to see a .NET engine port that can play using the original games resources. Perhaps it may reach a step further and include .NET map editing and other tools. We'll see. 

Most of everything beyond this point was also, generated by Gemini.

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development. Many core functionalities are being implemented, and the game is not yet in a playable state. Contributions are welcome!

It currently compiles, and crashes with an exception `Unable to load DLL 'SDL2_mixer' or one of its dependencies`

## Features (Planned)

*   **Faithful Recreation:** Accurate porting of game logic, graphics, and sound from the original DOS version.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux using .NET.
*   **Modernization:** Leveraging modern .NET features for better performance and maintainability.
*   **Moddability:** Potential for future modding support.

## Technologies Used

*   **dotnet8:** The core framework for the game.
*   **C#:** The primary programming language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (latest version recommended)
*   [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or your preferred C# IDE)

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Xargon.NET.git
    cd Xargon.NET
    ```
2.  **Restore NuGet packages:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```
3.  **Build the solution:**
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

### Running the Project (Once Playable)

Once the game reaches a playable state, you will be able to run it using:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Xargon.NET.Game/Xargon.NET.Game.csproj
